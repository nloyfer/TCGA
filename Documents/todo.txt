enable attatching a file with list of cpg-s to learn

clean up the tree visualization (no gini etc.). make smarter file names for the trees images.

gen_datasets - sample equaly from every class.


find the support vectors of a good solution, and study them (prefer sparse ones)
is there a way to force a sparse solution?


try with coef != 0.0

investigate the methods: probability, shrinking,

play with gamma.

when moving to multi-labeling, set decision_function_shape=‘ovo’

use sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV with C and gamma spaced exponentially far apart to choose good values.

some kind of smart feature selection
